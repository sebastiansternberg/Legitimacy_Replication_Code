GIP data collection.

To assess the data for the GIP part of the replication, you first have to obtain the data from GESIS – Leibniz Institute for the Social Sciences. You need to collect three datasets. GIP waves 25, 26 and 27 and merge them.

Proceed as follows:

1.	Register at GESIS, of you have not done so: https://www.gesis.org/en/home.
2.	You can access the three data sets via the GESIS website: You can type in the search function the name of the dataset, e.g. “GIP wave 25”
3.	The direct link for GIP wave 25 is: https://search.gesis.org/research_data/ZA6757
4.	The direct link for GIP wave 26 is: https://search.gesis.org/research_data/ZA6758
5.	The direct link for GIP wave 27 is: https://search.gesis.org/research_data/ZA6901
6.	Download the codebook
7.	Please fill out the data request form for all three datasets and request the datasets from GESIS.
8.	Name the datasets as specified in the replication code.
9.	Merge the data according to the replication code.


The Zelig version used in the main code is out-dated. In order to use it, we provide script XXXX to install the Zelig Version used in the analysis scripts. 




To replicate the German findings, run the code in the following order:
